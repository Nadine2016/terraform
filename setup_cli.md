## Installing the Terraform CLI and the IBM Cloud Provider plug-in
{: #install_cli}

To use Terraform to manage {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources, you must install the Terraform CLI and the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform. 
{: shortdesc}

**What is the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Provider plug-in and why do I need it?**</br>
To support a multi-cloud approach, Terraform works with cloud providers. A cloud provider is responsible for understanding the resources that you can provision, their API, and the methods to expose these resources in the cloud. To provision resources in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you must install the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Provider plug-in for Terraform. The plug-in is aware of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources that you can provision with Terraform and the syntax to describe them.  

1. Install Terraform on your local machine. 
   1. Create a folder on your local system that is called `terraform` and navigate into your folder. 
      ```
      mkdir terraform && cd terraform
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. [Download the Terraform binary to your local machine ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html). 

   3. Extract the Terraform package and copy the binary into your `terraform` directory. 
   4. Point the `$PATH` environment variable to your Terraform binary.
      ```
      export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/terraform
      ```
      {: pre}
      
   5. Verify that the installation is successful by using a `terraform` command.
      ```
      terraform
      ```
      {: pre}
      
      Example output: 
      ```
      Usage: terraform [-version] [-help] <command> [args]
