# Getting help and support 
{: #gettinghelp}

If you have problems or questions when you use Terraform or Ansible, you can get help from the open source community by searching for information on the internet or by asking questions through many of the forums and websites that support these widely used tools.

When you use the public forums to ask a question, tag your question so that it is seen by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development and support teams.
* If you have technical questions about Terraform on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, post your question on [Stack Overflow ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=ibm-cloud-infrastructure+terraform){:new_window} and tag your question with `ibm-cloud-infrastructure` and `terraform`.
* Subscribe to the [Terraform channel on Reddit ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.reddit.com/r/Terraform/){:new_window} and browse through this channel to read about user issues and how they resolved them. 

For more information about how to use the forums, see [Getting help](/docs/support/index.html#getting-help).

You can also contact IBM Support by opening a case. To learn about opening an IBM support case, or about support levels and case severities, see [Contacting support](/docs/get-support/howtogetsupport.html).
